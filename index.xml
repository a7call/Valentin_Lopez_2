      <description>Accompanied by a team of 5 people, I have been developing Space Wander since June 2020. This project was born out of a desire to make a game on a larger scale than my previous projects.
Space Wander is a Roguelike set in an apocalyptic future where aliens / demons are at the gates of planet earth. You play as a combat-trained astronaut whose goal is to defeat alien forces in order to save humanity.</description>

      <description>The FisherMan is a game developed for the mobile platform during the spring of 2020. The concept is simple, you play as a fisher / sushi master whose goal is to transform as many fish as possible into delicious sushi. In your quest for fresh fish, you will need to beware of any surprises the ocean may hide.
The FisherMan is my first commercial video game project. After a few months of exploring and learning the skills necessary to create a game, I decided to embark on an original project.</description>

      <description>Prison Break is a game made in 48 hours in the card of the Game jam GMTK which took place during the weekend of June 11, 2021. With two friends, we decided to participate in this edition of GMTK Game jam. This year the theme was: &amp;ldquo;Joined together&amp;rdquo;. For the design of this game, we opted for an action game.
Michael and Lincoln escaped from prison. Tied by the hands the two prisoners must flee, the rope which hinders them allows them to defeat the forces of order.</description>
